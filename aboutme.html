      <p> My name is Judah Roberts, and I'm a freshman at Indiana University majoring
        in Computer Science. From a young age, I was obsessed in anything rooted in logic.
        From arguing, to puzzles or math, logic based activity has always enthralled me. This affinity led me down many roads,
        including competitive Pokemon, competitive fighting games, and eventually programming. I began
        programming my Junior year of High School, and was instantly intrigued. I knew that something computer-based
        was what I wanted to do for my career. This love for logic sparked a drive to improve my computer skills.
        During my senior year of High-School, I began to really get into programming and computers. During this time I created
        many of the projects that can be found in this portfolio, and was lucky enough to have the opportunity to become a Catapult intern.
        It was during this internship that I was able to hone my computer skills. I learned new languages, cultivated new connections,
        and created new projects. This portfolio is the culmination of my programming journey and Catapult internship.
